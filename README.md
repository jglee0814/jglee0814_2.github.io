## Introduction
Hello, my name is Jungwoo, and I'm 23 years old. While I am technically Korean, I was born in America, which has given me a unique perspective and language skills. Currently, I'm a sophomore at a university, pursuing my academic journey.

## Skills
I have a strong command of the English language, a skill I've developed over the years thanks to my American heritage. I was once bilingual, but as I've spent more time in Korea, my proficiency in Korean has grown significantly. Besides language skills, I have a passion for cooking, and I take pride in creating delicious meals. Additionally, I am an avid photographer, using my Canon camera to capture moments and scenes that inspire me.

## Education
I'm a proud student at Sunkyunkwan University, where I'm currently a sophomore. My primary major is Advanced Materials Science Engineering, and I have a secondary major in the Department of Software. My dedication to my studies has been recognized with scholarships for three consecutive semesters due to my excellent academic performance. Moreover, I am actively involved on campus as a student council member in the Advanced Materials Science Engineering department and have the honor of serving as the president of the photography club.

## Achievements and Certifications
One of my noteworthy achievements includes being the recipient of scholarships for three semesters in a row, reflecting my consistent commitment to academic excellence.
